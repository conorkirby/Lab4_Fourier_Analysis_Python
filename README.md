# Lab 4: Fourier Analysis using Python

This repository contains the code and documentation for **Lab 4**, which focuses on **Fourier Analysis** using Python. The lab introduces key concepts such as:

- **Fourier series**
- **Fourier transforms**
- **Discrete Fourier transforms (DFT)**
- **Simpson’s rule** for numerical integration.

The exercises guide you through implementing Python scripts to perform Fourier analysis on both **periodic** and **non-periodic signals**, including square waves, rectangular waves, and damped sine waves. You will also explore the effects of **sampling rates** and **aliasing**, and learn how to reconstruct signals from their Fourier components.

## Lab Structure

The lab is divided into three main exercises:

1. **Simpson’s Rule and Fourier Series**: Implement Simpson’s rule for numerical integration and use it to compute Fourier series coefficients for various periodic functions.
2. **Fourier Transform for Non-Periodic Functions**: Extend the analysis to non-periodic signals using the Fourier transform and explore the concept of the **Nyquist frequency**.
3. **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**: Implement a DFT to analyze sampled signals and reconstruct them from their Fourier components.

## Repository Contents

- **Python scripts** for each exercise.
- **Plots** and visualizations to help understand the results.

This lab is a great opportunity to deepen your understanding of **signal processing** and **numerical methods** in Python. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own projects!
