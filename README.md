# Lab 4: Fourier Analysis using Python

This repository contains the code and documentation for **Lab 4**, which focuses on **Fourier Analysis** using Python. The lab introduces key concepts such as:

- **Fourier series**
- **Fourier transforms**
- **Discrete Fourier transforms (DFT)**
- **Simpson’s rule** for numerical integration.

The exercises guide you through implementing Python scripts to perform Fourier analysis on both **periodic** and **non-periodic signals**, including square waves, rectangular waves, and damped sine waves. You will also explore the effects of **sampling rates** and **aliasing**, and learn how to reconstruct signals from their Fourier components.

## Lab Structure

The lab is divided into three main exercises:

### 1. Simpson’s Rule and Fourier Series
- Implement **Simpson’s rule** for numerical integration.
- Use it to compute **Fourier series coefficients** for periodic functions like sine, cosine, and custom waveforms.
- Reconstruct signals using the computed coefficients and visualize the results.

### 2. Fourier Transform for Non-Periodic Functions
- Extend the analysis to **non-periodic signals** using the **Fourier transform**.
- Explore the concept of the **Nyquist frequency** and its implications for signal sampling.
- Analyze the frequency spectrum of non-periodic signals.

### 3. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- Implement a **DFT** to analyze sampled signals.
- Reconstruct signals from their Fourier components.
- Investigate the effects of **sampling rates** and **aliasing** on the frequency spectrum.

## Repository Contents

- **Python scripts** for each exercise.
- **Plots** and visualizations to help understand the results.

This lab is a great opportunity to deepen your understanding of **signal processing** and **numerical methods** in Python. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own projects!
